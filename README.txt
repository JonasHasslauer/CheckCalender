Hey, 

I am new to programming in general.
I decided to write a programm in python, which checks an API (https://date.nager.at/Api) which return public holidays in a specific state.

My programm extracts some information about the country. In the end, the user can specify his holidays in which he/she is free.
If some other person is free on the same holiday, the programm will print the matching date.

If you see my code, feel free to comment so I can learn sth new.
